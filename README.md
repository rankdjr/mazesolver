# Maze Solver

## Overview
Maze Solver is a Python-based application designed to generate and solve mazes. Utilizing a blend of graphical representation and algorithmic logic, it offers a visually engaging way to explore the creation and solving of complex mazes. Built with educational and entertainment purposes in mind, this tool provides insights into algorithmic processes, such as recursive backtracking, for maze generation and solving.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- A graphics library compatible with the project (details on setting this up should be provided based on the `graphics.py` file's dependencies).

### Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP of the project.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
3. Install any dependencies as specified in the project documentation.

## Usage

To run the Maze Solver, navigate to the project directory and execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will launch a graphical window displaying the maze generation process, followed by the solving algorithm in action.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: Dynamically generates a random maze using recursive backtracking.
- **Maze Solving**: Employs a solving algorithm to find a path from the entrance to the exit.
- **Graphical Interface**: Visualizes both the maze generation and solving processes in real-time.
